*Featues*

*Features*
- `outputDatasetId` can now also use dataset name. If dataset with that name doesn't exist, a new dataset is created.

*Fixes:*
- `dedup-as-loading` mode now works correctly with actor migrations. This means that this actor can finally be used for huge datasets with lower memory!

*Features:*
- `fields` are now optional which means the actor does not need to perform deduplication
